# PHASE-1
## Database and Entity-Relation (ER) Diagram Design    

## The goal of this project is to design and impliment a simple version of twitter by using MySql and PHP, your application shuold have these fuctions below:

1. User can signin and login with username and password.
2. User can post message (like what you do when you post a twitts).
3. User can follow and unfollow other users.
4. User can send message to a specific user.
5. User can comment the post.
+ During Phase1, your task is to design a conceptual model of the database and an ER diagram that can achieve these fuctions. You need to model the data stored in the database (Identify the entities, roles, relationships, constraints, etc.), show attributes (and non-trivial roles, when appropriate) for each entity/relationship type.

You should also start making notes/plans on the design of your application (do not write out the application code, but you should have a draft design of how you will implement your system).
